**Description** : The curernt situation for the GomataVision is they have diffrent applications for saving customers data and their project data.
Here in this they are facing issue in relating the customers data with the projects data as they are unable to cocnlude their sales as per the advitisment. 
As a solution we come up with a application which can hold and link the data between the leads and check for them as their are either being a customer before, and details such as these customer are interested or not, and other details.


**Requirement** : The system is designed to bring customer and project management together into a single, easy-to-use platform. It will simplify how data is entered and accessed, helping the marketing team quickly evaluate and follow up on potential leads. Additionally, the system will generate useful reports and insights to support the operations team in planning and decision-making. To ensure data is handled securely and appropriately, access permissions will be based on the organizationâ€™s hierarchy, giving different levels of control to different roles.
